Clone the repository into your /tmp file directory. This directory is being used because by default everything will be deleted once your reboot your computer. 
```
git clone https://github.com/seanherbert105/DevSecOps-class.git
```

Next, go into the bin directory and run the bash script getting-started.sh
```
bash getting-started.sh
```

Now the Jenkins UI should be available on localhost (which is running on your local computer and not accessible to anyone else).
```
http://localhost:8080
```
The login information to jenkins is the following.
